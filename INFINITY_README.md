## 🏗️ System Architecture

---

## 📋 Manifest System

Every Infinity repo includes an `infinity.manifest.json` that declares:
- **Role**: builder, reader, watcher, etc.
- **Layer**: plateau or plus
- **Inputs/Outputs**: Data flow specification
- **Commands**: Exposed functionality
- **UI Surfaces**: Available views
- **Economic Relevance**: Currency participation

The manifest makes the system self-documenting and discoverable.

## 🎯 Key Principles

### 1. Every Website is a Token
Not metaphorically. Literally. The token IS the website, not a representation.

### 2. No Staging, No Previews
Everything deploys live immediately. One click from idea to deployed asset.

### 3. Intent is Truth
User queries are the source of truth. System rebuilds from intent if files are lost.

### 4. Guest-First
Full viewing access without auth. Login only required for editing/trading.

### 5. Failure Immunity
System detects and recovers from destructive changes automatically.

## 🔄 Trading Flow

```
Owner Sets Price → Website Listed → Buyer Clicks Purchase → 
∞ Balance Checked → Transaction Executed → 
Ownership Transferred → Token Moved → ∞ Exchanged
```

All steps are atomic. Failure at any point rolls back completely.

---

## 👥 Collaboration Flow

```
Owner Adds Collaborator → Role Selected (Editor/Viewer) → 
Wallet Address Verified → Access Granted → 
Collaborator Can View/Edit → Owner Can Remove Anytime
```

---

## 🎨 Theme System

Themes are applied at website creation and persist across all pages. Each theme provides:
- Custom color palette
- Typography choices
- Layout styling
- Visual atmosphere

Preview each theme before creation on the home screen.

---

## 💎 Symbolic Cart Logic

The Infinity system follows this progression:

```
🛒 (Orchestrator) + 📶 (Growth Signal) → 
🎛️ (Modulator) → 
💎 (Faceted Cart) → 
👑 (Completed Asset)
```

No steps can be skipped. This ensures quality and completeness.

5. **One-Click Deployment**: No staging environments
